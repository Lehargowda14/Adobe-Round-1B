      "refined_text": "Famous Dishes The South of France is home to many iconic dishes that you must try during your visit: • Bouillabaisse: A traditional fish stew from Marseille, made with various types of fish, shellfish, and a flavorful broth seasoned with saﬀron and herbs. Bouillabaisse is typically served with rouille, a garlicky mayonnaise, and crusty bread. The dish is a celebration of the sea and is best enjoyed in a seaside restaurant with a view of the Mediterranean. • Ratatouille: A vegetable stew made with eggplant, zucchini, bell peppers, tomatoes, and onions, seasoned with herbs de Provence. Ratatouille can be served as a main dish or as a side, and it pairs beautifully with grilled meats or fish. The dish is a testament to the region's love for fresh, seasonal produce. • Salade Niçoise: A refreshing salad with tuna, hard-boiled eggs, tomatoes, green beans, olives, and anchovies, dressed with olive oil and vinegar. Salade Niçoise is a perfect example of the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes fresh vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It's a light yet satisfying dish that is perfect for a warm summer day. • Socca: A thin, crispy pancake made from chickpea flour, olive oil, and water, typically enjoyed as a street food in Nice. Socca is cooked in a wood-fired oven and is best eaten hot, straight from the oven. It's a simple yet delicious snack that showcases the region's love for humble, rustic dishes. • Cassoulet: A hearty casserole from the Languedoc region, made with white beans, sausage, and duck or pork. Cassoulet is a labor of love, requiring hours of slow cooking to develop its rich, complex flavors. The dish is a comforting and satisfying meal that is perfect for a chilly evening. • Tarte Tropézienne: A dessert from Saint-Tropez, consisting of a brioche filled with a creamy mixture of pastry cream and butter. Tarte Tropézienne is a sweet treat that is perfect for a special occasion or as an indulgent afternoon snack. The dessert was created by a Polish baker in the 1950s and quickly became a favorite among locals and tourists alike.",
